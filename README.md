Real Time D&amp;D

The plan is to have a page the DM veiws and a page for each player.
Each player will have a number of seconds (determined by the DM) to decide what
their character will do for the next 6 seconds. Players can chat (meta-game) to
decide but must enter their decision in the provided web page. After time
expires, no further changes can be made and the DM interprets each player's
input and resolves all actions simultaneously.

The DM can set a timer that will count down. Once reaching 0, the all player's
actions are locked and cannot be further modified. The desired actions are
then sent to the DM who resolves all of them simultaneously and reports to the
group the new state and then restarts the timer.

Players do not have to wait for the timer to reach 0 to lock in their actions.
They will also have a 'Ready' button allowing them to prematurely push their
desired actions to the DM.

Among the nice-to-have-but-not-necessary features are the following:
* A map/grid showing noteworthy features (such as objects, monsters and players)
  It would also be nice to have this be clickable allowing players to plot paths
  and/or select objects to interact with
* An edit-able character sheet
  This will allow for quick easy selection of abilities
